## Issues
My programming won't always be good and bugs and issues can arise.

If and when that happens you can always create an issue in my repo and I'll try to fix it as fast as I can.

### Bug report
This is a simple format you can follow

## [Title]

- Brief Description of bug/s
1. Try to be detailed with the bug report, try to tell in detail what and why you think it may have happened, also what you did before it happened.
2. If there is already an existing issue of the same nature, please don't recreate the issue and instead leave a comment on the issue.
3. Please do not try to rush me as I make these cogs on my own free time, I am not a machine.

### Feature Request
This issue label is made so that you can submit a Feature Request

This can be either an original or a feature from another cog.
